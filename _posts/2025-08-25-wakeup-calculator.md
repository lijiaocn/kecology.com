### Q: What time should I wake up tomorrow to feel great and not groggy?

"Some mornings I jump out of bed feeling refreshed, but other days it's a real struggle and I feel sluggish for hours. What's the secret to consistently waking up feeling energized? What time should i wake up tomorrow？"

### A: The trick is to wake up at the end of a sleep cycle.

That groggy feeling? It's from your alarm waking you during deep sleep. Our bodies use 90-minute sleep cycles. To feel refreshed, wake up at the end of a cycle when sleep is lightest.

Use the calculator above to find your best wake-up times. The diagram below shows how this works.
